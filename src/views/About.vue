          <p class='comment'>Jaren is the absolute genius that set up this beauty of a website. He is skilled in 1000 different languages and has inherited control of the nonexistent yet profound Helping Hands nonprofit organization. They have helped more than 27 million hands worldwide. Any doubters should send their messages to 1738 IHateHelpingPeople Drive. Standard postage rates will apply.</p>

        <p class='comment'>Mr. Earl is the BYU Real Estate Club VP. That's it. He has no other skills nor oddities about him. He is a finance bro through and through. Also, he enjoys the Netflix series "Dark," and watches it on occasion with his friend Jaren. It's a good show, but watch it on VidAngel for sure. Anyways, Dallin's cool.</p>

        <p class='comment'>Cason Curriden, a native of America with skin white as clouds, speaks fluent Krio and has visited Africa many times. He spends his time doing humanitarian work and Helping Hands all over the world. Unfortunately, he lost his left arm in a crocodile attack, but that has no effect on his fearlessness as he can be frequently spotted riping through the streets on a souped-up moped.</p>

        <p class='comment'>Mr. Curriden part 2 enjoys long walks on the beach and long finance conversations with anyone who will listen. He insists he is the stronger twin but, as recent investigation has shown, weighs 20 pounds less than his counterpart. Despite his inherent weakness, Dallin has a kind heart and is a beast on the wakeboard. If you even need investment advice, he's your guy.</p>

        <p class='comment'>Taylor is beautiful and insanely smart (also funny). She recently got a job as an Executive Assistant at Harmon Brothers, which is excellent especially in this job market. She enjoys watching Clone Wars and chilling with her boyfriend who is, as of the time I am writing this, extremely handsome.</p>
